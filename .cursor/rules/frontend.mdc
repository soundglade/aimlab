# AIM Lab Frontend Conventions

This document provides key information about the frontend architecture and conventions.

## Project Structure

- @src/pages/ - Next.js pages directory containing all route components
  - @src/pages/admin/ - Admin dashboard and management interfaces
  - @src/pages/playground/ - Interactive playground features
- @src/components/ - Reusable UI components
- @src/styles/ - Global styles and CSS modules
- @src/lib/ - Utility functions and shared logic

## Key Conventions

### Styling
- We use Tailwind CSS for styling (@src/styles/globals.css)
- Avoid using color classes. Instead use shadcn/ui semantic classes (i.e. bg-primary)
- Custom styles should be minimal and only used when Tailwind isn't sufficient
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles

### Content Style
- Keep it simple
- Use gentle, mindful language that invites rather than demands
- Keep text minimal and purposeful
- Write with a calm, supportive tone
