    script: `# 5-Minute Grounding Meditation

## Introduction
Welcome to this short grounding meditation. In the next few minutes, we'll work together to bring you back to the present moment, connecting you with your body and the earth beneath you. [pause for 5 seconds]

## Setting Intention
Begin by finding a comfortable position, either seated or lying down. Allow your body to be supported, and give yourself permission to be fully present for these next few minutes. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Breath Awareness
Start by bringing your attention to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your inhales and exhales. There's no need to change anything, simply observe the breath moving in and out of your body. [pause for 15 seconds]

Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest and abdomen with each breath. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Body Connection
Now, bring your awareness to the points where your body makes contact with the surface beneath you. [pause for 5 seconds]

Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your legs, the pressure of your sitting bones or back against the chair or mat. [pause for 15 seconds]

Feel the support that is holding you up right now. Allow yourself to surrender a little more of your weight into that support. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Sensory Awareness
Expand your awareness to notice five things you can see in your environment. Take your time to observe shapes, colors, and textures. [pause for 20 seconds]

Now, notice four things you can feel - perhaps the temperature of the air on your skin, the texture of your clothing, or the firmness of the surface beneath you. [pause for 20 seconds]

Become aware of three sounds in your environment, near or far. [pause for 20 seconds]

Notice two scents that you can smell right now. [pause for 15 seconds]

Finally, observe one taste in your mouth. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Earth Connection
Imagine roots extending from the base of your spine down through the floor, through the layers of the earth, deep into its core. [pause for 10 seconds]

With each exhale, release any tension, stress, or scattered energy down through these roots into the earth. [pause for 15 seconds]

With each inhale, draw up stability, support, and nourishment from the earth. [pause for 15 seconds]

Feel yourself becoming more stable, more present, more grounded with each breath cycle. [pause for 20 seconds]

## Closing
As we prepare to conclude this practice, take a few moments to appreciate the stability and presence you've cultivated. [pause for 10 seconds]

When you're ready, gently wiggle your fingers and toes, perhaps stretch your body if that feels good, and slowly open your eyes if they've been closed. [pause for 15 seconds]

Carry this grounded feeling with you as you continue with your day.`,

    script: `# Self-Care for Caregivers Meditation

## Introduction
Welcome to this moment that belongs entirely to you. As someone who dedicates so much energy to caring for others, these next few minutes are a gift you're giving to yourself. [pause for 5 seconds]

## Setting the Space
Find a comfortable position where you can be fully supported. Allow your body to settle and your mind to recognize that during this time, you have no responsibilities except to yourself. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Permission to Rest
Take a deep breath in through your nose. [pause for 3 seconds]
And release it completely through your mouth with a sigh. [pause for 5 seconds]

With each breath, give yourself permission to temporarily set aside the weight of responsibility you carry. [pause for 10 seconds]

You spend so much time attending to others' needs. Right now, you are allowed to attend to your own. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Compassionate Body Scan
Bring your awareness to your shoulders, which carry so much. Notice if they're holding tension. [pause for 8 seconds]

With your next exhale, allow your shoulders to soften and release. [pause for 8 seconds]

Move your attention to your hands, which do so much caring work. Notice any sensations present. [pause for 8 seconds]

Imagine you could pour warmth and appreciation into your hands, honoring all they do. [pause for 10 seconds]

Bring awareness to your heart, which holds so much compassion for others. [pause for 8 seconds]

Place one hand over your heart if that feels comfortable. Breathe into this space, acknowledging your capacity for care. [pause for 15 seconds]

Now notice your jaw, which may hold unspoken words or unexpressed needs. [pause for 8 seconds]

Gently release any tension in your jaw, perhaps allowing your lips to part slightly. [pause for 10 seconds]

Finally, bring attention to your forehead, which carries so many thoughts and concerns. [pause for 8 seconds]

Imagine smoothing away any furrows or lines of worry. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Replenishing Breath
Now visualize that with each inhale, you're drawing in fresh, replenishing energy. [pause for 8 seconds]

See this energy as a soft, healing light filling your body. [pause for 10 seconds]

With each exhale, release fatigue, stress, and anything that no longer serves you. [pause for 10 seconds]

Continue this breathing pattern, nourishing yourself with each inhale, releasing with each exhale. [pause for 20 seconds]

## Self-Compassion Moment
Silently offer yourself these words:
"Just as I care for others, I deserve care too." [pause for 8 seconds]
"I am doing enough. I am enough." [pause for 8 seconds]
"I honor my needs and my limits." [pause for 8 seconds]
"I give myself permission to rest and renew." [pause for 10 seconds]

## Boundaries Visualization
Imagine yourself surrounded by a gentle boundary‚Äînot a wall, but a translucent membrane. [pause for 8 seconds]

This boundary allows your compassion to flow outward, but also protects your energy and wellbeing. [pause for 10 seconds]

Visualize this boundary glowing with soft light, defining the sacred space that is yours alone. [pause for 10 seconds]

Know that maintaining this boundary is not selfish‚Äîit's necessary for sustainable care. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Closing
As we prepare to end this practice, make a small commitment to yourself‚Äîperhaps a moment of rest, a boundary you'll honor, or a simple pleasure you'll enjoy today. [pause for 15 seconds]

Take a deep breath in. [pause for 3 seconds]
Release it slowly. [pause for 5 seconds]

When you're ready, gently wiggle your fingers and toes, and slowly open your eyes if they've been closed.

Carry this feeling of self-compassion with you as you return to your caregiving role, remembering that caring for yourself is part of caring for others.`,

*A short meditation for developers seeking focus and flow.*

## üßò Introduction

Welcome.  
This is a short meditation designed for coders, tinkerers, and digital architects  
who‚Äôve been staring at a screen long enough to forget where their body ends  
and the terminal begins.  

Let‚Äôs unplug the mind for a moment, without pulling the whole power cable.

[pause for 5 seconds]

---

## üß† Resetting the Mind

Take a deep breath in...  
And exhale slowly.

[pause for 5 seconds]

Feel the sensation of your body sitting.  
Chair, floor, cushion‚Äîwhatever you're on‚Äîit's supporting you.  
You don‚Äôt need to support *everything* right now.

[pause for 8 seconds]

Notice your hands.  
Not typing. Not clicking. Just... being hands.

[pause for 6 seconds]

If your mind is still looping through if-statements and error messages,  
just notice it with a smirk.  
"Ah yes, the debugger within."

[pause for 6 seconds]

---

## ü´Å Finding Your Anchor

Now bring your attention gently to the breath.  
No need to optimize it.  
Let it run in whatever janky version it‚Äôs currently using.

[pause for 10 seconds]

Breath in.  
Breath out.  
Simple, boring, perfect.

[pause for 10 seconds]

You‚Äôre not here to *do* anything right now.  
You‚Äôre just noticing.  
Observing the code of your own awareness...  
without trying to fix the bugs.

[pause for 8 seconds]

---

## üß© Returning to Clarity

Let thoughts come and go, like logs in a console.  
You don‚Äôt have to respond.  
Not every warning is urgent.

[pause for 8 seconds]

As the mind quiets a little,  
see if there‚Äôs a small feeling of space‚Äî  
a fresh commit of clarity starting to push through.

[pause for 10 seconds]

---

## üíæ Closing the Session

Take one more deep breath.

And when you're ready...  
Wiggle your fingers.  
Feel your seat.  
And gently open your eyes, or refocus your gaze.

[pause for 6 seconds]

You're back.  
Maybe 2% clearer.  
Which, let's face it, is better than most refactors.

---

## üß≠ Optional Prompt

Before returning to work, you might ask:  
**‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one small thing I *don‚Äôt* need to do right now?‚Äù**

Sometimes clarity begins with subtraction.

*A playful meditation for sharpening attention through gentle curiosity.*

## üêæ Introduction

Welcome.  
This is *Curious Cat*‚Äîa meditation for exploring your inner world  
like a cat investigates a new cardboard box:  
with interest, hesitation, and the occasional sudden zoomies.  

[pause for 5 seconds]

No need to achieve anything here.  
You‚Äôre just here to look around.

[pause for 5 seconds]

---

## üëÉ Sniffing the Moment

Let‚Äôs start by noticing what‚Äôs here‚Äîright now.  
Noticing is the key word.  
Not analyzing. Not fixing. Just... noticing.

[pause for 6 seconds]

What‚Äôs the air like?  
The sounds around you?  
The tension in your tail?  
(Okay, maybe no tail. But check your shoulders.)

[pause for 8 seconds]

---

## üëÅÔ∏è Gentle Curiosity

Let your attention move like a curious cat.  
Poking into corners.  
Sniffing a strange noise.  
Backing off if it gets weird.  

[pause for 6 seconds]

What‚Äôs happening in your breath right now?  
Don‚Äôt control it‚Äîjust be near it.  
Like you're lying next to it on a windowsill.

[pause for 10 seconds]

Now, what‚Äôs the mood in your body?  
No labels. Just tones. Sensations.  
Fluffiness? Tension? Sleepy paws?

[pause for 10 seconds]

---

## üåÄ Wandering with Awareness

Let your attention wander.  
But keep it *softly tethered*‚Äî  
as if there‚Äôs an invisible string from you to this moment.

[pause for 8 seconds]

And when your thoughts leap up like a cat spotting a shadow,  
just notice: ‚ÄúAh, mind doing mind things.‚Äù

No need to chase it.  
Let it come back when it‚Äôs ready.

[pause for 10 seconds]

---

## üê± Returning to the Present

Take one deeper breath in...  
And exhale with a little sigh, if you like.

[pause for 6 seconds]

Notice that you‚Äôve been here this whole time.  
Just hanging out.  
A curious cat in the sunshine of now.

[pause for 6 seconds]

---

## üß∂ Optional Prompt

Before you go:  
**What‚Äôs one thing in your environment you haven‚Äôt really noticed today?**  
Go find it. Look at it like a cat would.  
And maybe knock it off the table.  

(Just kidding. Mostly.)

    script: `# Too Much Input

*A quiet meditation for when everything feels like‚Ä¶ too much.*

---

## üå´Ô∏è Arrival

Welcome.  
If you're here, something might feel overloaded‚Äî  
senses, thoughts, emotions, all blinking at once.

[pause for 6 seconds]

You don‚Äôt need to fix it.  
You‚Äôre not broken.  
We‚Äôre just slowing everything down.  

[pause for 8 seconds]

---

## üå¨Ô∏è Simple Sensing

Take a slow breath in‚Ä¶  
And let it fall out, gently.

[pause for 10 seconds]

Now again.  
Just air moving in‚Ä¶  
And out.  
That‚Äôs all.

[pause for 12 seconds]

Let your eyes rest.  
Or close them, if that feels good.  
No need to look at anything.  

[pause for 10 seconds]

---

## ü´Ä Coming Back to Body

Bring attention to your feet.  
Notice where they touch the floor.  
No story. Just contact.

[pause for 10 seconds]

Now your hands.  
Where are they?  
Feel them without moving.

[pause for 10 seconds]

If there‚Äôs tightness anywhere‚Äî  
Don‚Äôt force it to release.  
Just be near it.  
Like sitting next to a friend who‚Äôs upset.

[pause for 12 seconds]

---

## üîâ Soften the Signals

Sounds may still be around you.  
Let them come.  
Let them go.  
You don‚Äôt have to make sense of them.

[pause for 10 seconds]

If thoughts feel loud,  
imagine turning the volume one notch down.  
Just one.

[pause for 10 seconds]

You don‚Äôt need silence.  
You just need space.

[pause for 12 seconds]

---

## üßò Staying Simple

Keep coming back to one thing:  
Breath in.  
Breath out.  
Just that.  

[pause for 12 seconds]

Or feel your feet.  
Or your hands.  
Pick one. Stay there.

[pause for 15 seconds]

---

## ü´ß Closing Gently

You‚Äôve made space.  
That matters.  

[pause for 6 seconds]

When you‚Äôre ready,  
look around the room‚Äîslowly.  
Notice a color.  
A shape.  
Something simple.

[pause for 10 seconds]

You don‚Äôt have to do anything next.  
Just‚Ä¶ a little more space than before.

---

## üß≠ Optional Prompt

If you want:  
**What‚Äôs one thing you could pause or mute for a little while?**  
It doesn‚Äôt need to be forever.  
Just long enough to breathe.
