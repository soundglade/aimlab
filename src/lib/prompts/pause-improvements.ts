PAUSE IMPROVEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
- IMPORTANT: Do not modify or rewrite the script text or headings in order to improve pauses. Only adjust the placement and duration of pauses between speech steps.
- Carefully review and improve the placement and duration of pauses in the script.
- Ensure all pauses are at least 3 seconds long; do not use shorter pauses.
- Check that there are not more than two consecutive speech steps without a pause in between. If so, add appropriate pauses to allow the text to breathe and give the listener time to reflect.
- Pay special attention to breathing exercises: if the script instructs the user to take several breaths, ensure there is a pause long enough for the user to complete them comfortably.
- Use your judgment to create a natural, thoughtful pacing. The goal is to provide enough time for the listener to absorb the guidance and have a good experience.
- Use shorter pauses (min 3 seconds) to let the speech breathe, and longer pauses (min 15 seconds) for user practice or exercises. Distinguish and apply each type as needed.

PAUSE TIMING GUIDELINES:
Use the following broad guidelines when assigning pause durations:
- Deep breath: Use 8 seconds per deep breath (inhale + exhale).
- 4-7-8 breathing: Use 20 seconds per cycle.
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4): Use 20 seconds per round.
- Coherent breathing: Use 15 seconds per breath.
- Single breath (relaxation): Use ~10 seconds.
- Body scan transitions: Use 5-10 seconds between each body part.
- Emotional prompts (e.g., 'let go', 'welcome'): Use at least 10 seconds.
- Final integration / closing silence: Use 15â€“60 seconds, proportional to session length.
