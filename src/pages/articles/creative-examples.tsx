          <p>
            Hi there! In this article I'm going to share some playful and
            creative experiments I've been doing to generate guided meditations
            using AI chatbots. My goal is to inspire you to try your own
            experiments and discover what's possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            For these experiments I've used a combination of different chatbots,
            but mostly Claude and ChatGPT.
          </p>

          <p>Let's dive right in.</p>

            Daily meditations in a particular style
          </h2>

          <p>
            Let's start with a simple experiment. Here, I wanted to see if a
            chatbot could generate a brief daily meditation, but in a specific
            style. I didn't provide detailed instructions, I simply allowed the
            chatbot to use its own knowledge. This experiment is interesting
            because it shows me just how much these chatbots already know about
            different meditation styles.
          </p>

          <Prompt>
            Can you create for me the script of a brief guided daily meditation
            that explores <b>non-duality and direct awareness</b> using secular,
            precise language? Please add also pause markers when appropriate in
            the format [pause for xx seconds].
          </Prompt>

          <h2 id="remixing-meditation">Remixing a favourite meditation</h2>

          <p>
            For my next experiment I explored remixing and altering existing
            meditations. I took a meditation by Loch Kelly from his YouTube
            channel and asked the chatbot to create something new based on it.
          </p>

          <iframe
            className="mx-auto aspect-video w-full max-w-xl"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it38xrSZUWc?si=xcdERcq5T02hRWfU&iv_load_policy=3&rel=0"
            title="YouTube video player"

            allowFullScreen
          ></iframe>
          <p>
            The process was straightforward: I downloaded the transcript from
            YouTube, gave it to the chatbot, and asked it to expand the
            meditation. Interestingly, the resulting meditation ended up almost
            three times longer, not just twice.
          </p>
          <Prompt>
            I attach the transcript of a guided meditation I like. Can you
            create a new meditation script based on this meditation, expanding
            each section proportionally so the final result is approximately
            twice as long as the original? Keep the language and style as close
            as possible to the original. Add headings and appropriate pause
            markers in the format [pause for xx seconds] throughout.
          </Prompt>

          />

          <p>
            The way the chatbot expanded the language is particularly
            fascinating. Here you can see examples of the original meditation
            alongside the expanded version. I've marked the newly added sections
            in bold for clarity.

          <p>
            But expanding length is just one way to remix meditations. Curious
            about other possibilities, I asked Gemini 2.5 (a chatbot) for
            creative ideas on how to transform a meditation.
          </p>

          <ChatbotResponse content={creativeRemixesResponse} truncateAt={246} />

          <p>
            The chatbot gave me some interesting suggestions. From those
            suggestions I picked a couple of particularly creative ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first remix aimed to shift the core focus of Loch's meditation
            toward gratitude. The chatbot remained faithful to the original
            practice of effortless mindfulness but introduced an interesting way
            of practicing gratitude with awareness. It even coined the term
            "grateful awareness" which reminds me of the more common "loving
            awareness".
          </p>

          <PlayButtonLine id="yce40ap" title="Gratitude Flow Meditation" />

          <p>
            For the second remix, I asked the chatbot to rewrite the meditation
            to make it suitable for children, using playful and simple language.
            The resulting meditation is quite cute, with charming concepts like
            the "magic bubble of awareness" and the "big sky mind".
          </p>

          <h2 id="inspired-talks">Meditations inspired by talks</h2>

          <p>
            These experiments so far highlight something important: the richer
            the context provided to the chatbot, the more interesting and
            meaningful the results. So, in the next experiment, I decided to go
            deeper. This time, I took a Zen talk (a Teisho) by Henry Shukman
            from YouTube and again used the transcript to start a conversation
            with the chatbot.
          </p>

          <iframe
            className="mx-auto aspect-video w-full max-w-xl"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9Ox9UG3ako?si=tTtKUA9HDrz4Xmz3&iv_load_policy=3&rel=0"
            title="YouTube video player"

            referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
            allowFullScreen
          ></iframe>

          <p>
            To make the process more structured I first asked for a summary of
            the talk, then requested several meditation ideas that would capture
            its essence. From the chatbot's suggestions, I chose one I liked,
            and we refined it into a full meditation script.
          </p>

          <Prompt>
            I'd like to explore creating a guided meditation that capture the
            essence of this talk, perhaps a brief meditation that could follow
            listening to the talk itself. Can you suggest how this meditation
            may be? What could be the main topic and structure? Please do not
            generate yet the script. Let's discuss it first.
          </Prompt>

          />

          <p>
            The result is... well, interesting! You can see it echoes the poetic
            essence of Henry's teachings... althought at times it also feels a
            bit like a word salad, as if it just tried to string together
            different words from the talk, without too much logic... 😅 I like
            it! Very Zen! 😉

          <p>
            I took things a step further: I gave the chatbot (Claude 3.7) an
            entire meditation manual. I chose "With Each and Every Breath", a
            meditation guide by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, available freely online.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created a new chat session, attached the PDF, and asked the
            chatbot to help me create a progressive series of meditations
            suitable for beginners. Before generating the scripts I discussed
            with the chatbot how best to structure the topics. Once agreed on a
            structure I asked the chatbot to generate one meditation at a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The outcome is remarkable: the topics, language, and overall
            accuracy seem to match the original material. I am genuinely
            impressed.

            For the final experiment I decided to try something even more
            creative and unusual. One evening, looking at a sunset from my
            balcony, I took a photo and asked a chatbot to create a guided
            meditation based on this very view. To make things more interesting
            I specifically asked it to follows the Headless Way style.

          <p>
            I love this meditation. It uses elements from the landscape (both
            visual and auditory) to guide attention while at the same time
            incorporating the essence of the Headless Way.
          </p>

          <p>
            This experiment opens up entirely new possibilities. Imagine
            generating meditations on the fly based on your surroundings, or
            perhaps using artworks or sacred images as starting points.

const dailyMeditationResponse = `# Daily Non-Dual Awareness Meditation

I've created a brief daily meditation script focusing on non-duality and direct awareness, using secular and precise language. The meditation guides you through:

1. Beginning with bodily relaxation and breath awareness
2. Expanding attention to include physical sensations
3. Shifting attention from experiences to awareness itself
4. Exploring the non-dual nature of awareness and experience
5. Resting as awareness without effort
6. Reconnecting with ordinary activity while maintaining awareness

The script includes appropriate pause markers at natural transition points to allow for integration of each section. You can adjust the pause durations based on your preference for a shorter or longer meditation session.

Would you like me to modify any aspects of the script, such as the length, specific language, or focus areas?

---
## Beginning

Find a comfortable position where your body can be at ease. You may sit or lie down, whatever allows you to be both alert and relaxed. Allow your eyes to close gently. [pause for 10 seconds]

Take three deep breaths, inhaling slowly through your nose and exhaling fully through your mouth. With each exhale, feel your body settling more deeply into its support. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Attention to Sensations

Now, bring your attention to the sensations of breathing. Notice the natural rhythm of your breath without trying to control it. Simply observe the rising and falling sensations. [pause for 20 seconds]

As you continue to breathe naturally, expand your awareness to include all physical sensations throughout your body. Notice the points of contact where your body touches its support. Feel the temperature of the air on your skin. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Noticing Awareness Itself

Now, gently shift your attention from what you're experiencing to the awareness that is experiencing it. Notice that there is an awareness that is cognizant of all sensations, thoughts, and emotions. [pause for 20 seconds]

This awareness itself has no form, no location, no boundary. It is simply present, open, and cognizant. Rest in the recognition that this awareness is what you fundamentally are. [pause for 30 seconds]

## Exploring Non-Duality

Notice that within this awareness, experiences arise and pass away. Sensations, sounds, thoughts – all appear within this field of knowing. [pause for 15 seconds]

Is there a separation between the awareness and what is being aware of? Can you find where awareness ends and experience begins? [pause for 20 seconds]

Notice that what we conventionally call "inside" and "outside" are both appearing within this same borderless awareness. The sound of a distant car, the sensation in your hand, the thought in your mind – all are equally appearances within this single field of knowing. [pause for 30 seconds]

## Resting as Awareness

Allow all effort to relax. You don't need to hold onto or push away any experience. Simply rest as the awareness within which all experiences come and go. [pause for 25 seconds]

Notice that awareness itself is effortlessly present. It doesn't come and go. It doesn't require maintenance. It is naturally present, naturally knowing. [pause for 20 seconds]

## Being and Doing

As we come to the end of this meditation, recognize that this awareness is not something you've created or achieved. It's what you already are and have always been – the knowing presence within which your entire life unfolds. [pause for 15 seconds]

When you're ready, gently allow your attention to include the space around you. Feel free to move your fingers and toes, and when you feel complete, open your eyes. [pause for 10 seconds]

As you move through your day, see if you can occasionally recognize this same awareness that is always here, always knowing – the foundation of all experience.

const lockKellyResponse = `I'll create an expanded meditation script based on the transcript you provided, while maintaining the style and flow of the original. I'll add section headings and pause markers to guide the timing.

I've created an expanded meditation script based on the transcript you provided. It maintains the same style, flow, and progressive movement of awareness through different parts of the body, but extends each section proportionally to make it approximately twice as long.

The script includes:
- Clear section headings to guide the practice
- Pause markers throughout (in the format [pause for xx seconds])
- The same gentle, instructive language style as the original
- The core progression from focused attention to expanded awareness

The meditation preserves the key elements from the original:
- Beginning with breath focus
- Noticing the observer position
- Moving awareness through the body
- Expanding to spacious awareness
- Discovering "already awake awareness"

# Expanded Clear Your Mind Guided Meditation
*Inspired by Loch Kelly's Effortless Mindfulness*

## Finding Comfort and Breath Awareness

Find a comfortable way of sitting. Allow your body to settle into a position that feels natural and supportive. [pause for 10 seconds]

Become aware of your breath in either your chest or your belly as it rises and relaxes. Simply notice the natural rhythm without trying to change it. [pause for 5 seconds]

Focus your attention there at this one area. Let your awareness rest gently on this single point of focus in your body as your breath rises and relaxes. [pause for 10 seconds]

When your mind wanders, as minds naturally do, simply bring it back to this simple one-pointed focus in your body. No judgment, just a gentle return to the breath as it rises and relaxes. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Noticing the Observer

Now as you're focusing on your breath at that area, feel the area from which you are focusing. Notice where in your body this observation seems to be happening from - usually somewhere in your head, behind your eyes. [pause for 10 seconds]

Take a moment to notice both the place where the breath is rising and the place from which the focusing is happening. Two distinct areas - the observed and the observer. [pause for 10 seconds]

Without needing to know exactly how you're doing it, feel as if you can unhook local awareness from the area from which you're focusing. There's no effort needed, just a gentle releasing. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Dropping Awareness

Feel local awareness like an invisible bubble of knowing. A small sphere of consciousness that can move on its own. Allow it to begin to drop downward through your head. [pause for 10 seconds]

First, know your jaw directly from within your jaw. Feel your jaw from the awareness within your jaw, as if the subject and object are located in the same place. Experience what it's like when awareness is within what it's aware of. [pause for 15 seconds]

Now notice that local awareness can move on its own to become aware of your throat directly from within your throat. [pause for 10 seconds]

Notice that you're not stretching attention down from your head to your throat. Instead, awareness itself has relocated. You're experiencing your throat from within your throat. [pause for 10 seconds]

Notice that you don't need to go back up to thought to know that you're aware of your throat from within your throat. Awareness knows itself directly, without the mediation of thinking. [pause for 15 seconds]

Just be aware of your throat from your throat - feeling the space, the aliveness, and the awareness in this one area. [pause for 10 seconds]

## Awareness in the Body

Now feel local awareness move on its own, dropping down below your neck to become aware of your chest. Let awareness settle in this new location. [pause for 10 seconds]

Become aware of your breath directly from within your chest or belly. Feel the rising and relaxing directly from where it's happening. Experience the breath from the inside out. [pause for 15 seconds]

Feel what it's like when the focusing and the focused are happening in the same place. Notice how different this is from observing your body from your head. [pause for 10 seconds]

Notice that the breath is happening by itself. You don't need to make it happen. It flows naturally, without effort, rising and falling in its own rhythm. [pause for 10 seconds]

And similarly, awareness is happening by itself. You don't need to create awareness - it's already present, already knowing. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Expanding Awareness

Let local awareness stay with the breath as awareness energy begins to open. Feel it expanding beyond the single point of focus. [pause for 10 seconds]

Allow this awareness to open to the spacious awareness outside and within your whole body. Feel it spreading like water filling every available space. [pause for 15 seconds]

Experience how this awareness can be both focused and expansive at the same time. It remains connected to the breath while also knowing the entirety of your being. [pause for 10 seconds]

When you're ready, become aware of the space in the room around you from the space in the room itself. Not looking at the room from your body, but experiencing the room from the awareness that permeates the room. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Discovering Limitless Awareness

Continue to let awareness open until it discovers the feeling of an already awake awareness that is both spacious and pervasive. [pause for 10 seconds]

Feel this awareness within your body, but not confined by your body. Experience your body like a seamless field of already awake awareness energy. [pause for 15 seconds]

Become aware of this limitless space of timeless, boundless, awake awareness. Notice how it has no edges, no beginning, and no end. It simply is - open, clear, and ever-present. [pause for 20 seconds]

Experience how this awareness isn't something you need to create or maintain. It's already here, already awake, already knowing. You're simply recognizing what has always been present. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Simultaneous Awareness

Notice that as you remain spacious and limitless, you can simultaneously be intimately aware of the arising awareness energy in your body. [pause for 10 seconds]

Feel the awareness in the room and directly from your breath arising at the center of your body. Multiple locations of knowing happening all at once. [pause for 15 seconds]

Notice that you're simultaneously aware from the limitless space, the energetic field, and your human body. All of these dimensions of experience are available to you at once. [pause for 15 seconds]

Experience how you can be in both the infinite and the particular at the same time. The vastness of open awareness and the specificity of bodily sensations co-existing without conflict. [pause for 15 seconds]

## Effortless Focus

Notice that you can be effortlessly focused on your breath from awake awareness without being distracted. There's no struggle to maintain attention - awareness naturally knows what's arising. [pause for 15 seconds]

Feel the calm, focus, clarity, and well-being that emerges from this effortless mindfulness. [pause for 10 seconds]

Experience how different this is from concentrated focus. Instead of narrowing attention, you're resting in an open awareness that naturally includes the breath without excluding anything else. [pause for 15 seconds]

Allow yourself to rest in this effortless mindfulness. Nothing to do, nowhere to go, simply being the awareness that you already are. [pause for 20 seconds]

## Resting in Awareness

As we bring this meditation to a close, continue to rest in this open, clear awareness. [pause for 10 seconds]

Notice how this awareness is always available to you. It's not something that meditation creates - it's what meditation reveals. [pause for 15 seconds]

When you're ready, you may slowly open your eyes while maintaining this sense of effortless awareness. Notice that opening the eyes doesn't change the fundamental nature of awareness - it simply includes more within its embrace. [pause for 15 seconds]

Carry this effortless mindfulness with you as you return to your day, knowing you can reconnect with this natural awareness at any time. [pause for 10 seconds]

const creativeRemixesResponse = `Okay, this is a fascinating area to explore! Using LLMs to creatively rewrite meditation scripts opens up many possibilities beyond just changing the length. Based on the "Effortless Mindfulness" script you provided, here are some creative ideas for using LLMs to alter existing meditation scripts:

1.  **Shift the Core Theme or Focus:**
    * **Gratitude Focus:** Modify the script to guide the user towards noticing things they are grateful for, perhaps linking it to the body sensations or the feeling of spacious awareness mentioned in your script.
    * **Self-Compassion:** Adapt the guidance to foster feelings of kindness and acceptance towards oneself, especially during moments of noticing the mind wandering.
    * **Loving-Kindness (Metta):** Rewrite sections to include phrases of well-wishing for oneself and others.
    * **Working with Specific Emotions:** Create versions tailored to mindfully exploring specific emotions like anxiety, sadness, or anger, using the body-awareness techniques as an anchor.

2.  **Adapt for Different Audiences:**
    * **For Children:** Simplify the language significantly, use more playful metaphors (e.g., awareness as a gentle cloud instead of a bubble), and shorten the duration.
    * **For Beginners:** Add more detailed explanations about *why* certain instructions are given (e.g., why focus on the breath), and offer more reassurance.
    * **For Specific Groups:** Tailor the imagery or focus to resonate with particular groups (e.g., artists focusing on creative energy, athletes on body awareness and focus).

3.  **Integrate Different Techniques:**
    * **Guided Imagery:** Weave in more vivid visualizations – perhaps expanding on the "spacious awareness" by guiding the user to imagine a specific landscape (forest, beach, cosmos).
    * **Affirmations:** Incorporate positive affirmations that align with the meditation's goal (e.g., "I am aware," "I can rest in this space").
    * **Sound Focus:** Adapt the script to guide awareness towards ambient sounds, integrating the external environment more explicitly.

4.  **Experiment with Sensory Language & Setting:**
    * **Enhanced Sensory Details:** Ask the LLM to enrich the script with more evocative descriptions of potential subtle feelings, temperatures, or textures within the body.
    * **Setting Simulation:** Create versions designed to evoke specific environments (e.g., "Meditation by the Ocean," "Forest Awareness") by adding relevant sensory cues.

5.  **Vary the Tone and Style:**
    * **Poetic Reframing:** Rewrite the script in a more lyrical or poetic style.
    * **Inquisitive Tone:** Frame the instructions as gentle questions or invitations to explore (e.g., "What happens if awareness rests in the throat?").
    * **Minimalist Version:** Condense the script to its absolute core instructions for a shorter, more direct practice.

6.  **Conceptual Blending:**
    * **Philosophical Integration:** Weave in brief, relevant quotes or concepts from philosophical or wisdom traditions that resonate with effortless mindfulness or non-dual awareness.
    * **Storytelling Elements:** Frame the meditation within a simple narrative structure.

7.  **Interactive or Dynamic Ideas (More Complex):**
    * **Modular Scripts:** Create distinct sections (e.g., Body Scan, Breath Focus, Open Awareness) that an LLM could potentially reorder or combine in different ways.
    * **Personalization Prompts:** Design scripts that prompt the user (at the beginning) for a specific focus (e.g., "What quality do you want to cultivate today?") and have the LLM subtly weave that theme in.

Think of the original script as a foundation. You can ask an LLM to take specific elements (like the concept of awareness dropping from the head, or the feeling of limitless space) and reimagine them in these different contexts.

This sounds like a really creative project. Which of these directions seems most interesting for your experiments?
