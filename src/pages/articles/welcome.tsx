            Hi there, For the past year I've been fascinated to explore what AI
            can do for the world of meditation. It still feels like a strange
            frontier, where things can equally be glitchy or hominous, and
            promising and exciting.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I'm going through (just another ðŸ˜…) mid-life crisis and changin
            career, I'm exploring developing new projects in this space.
          </p>

          <p>
            While exploring this strange world I started to think this is still
            a space where collective exploration needs to take place.
          </p>

          <p>
            What could it be a future where AI becomes our source of wisdom,
            even contemplative guidance?
          </p>

          <p>
            Just like OpenAI a couple of years ago decided to open up their core
            technology to everyone, with ChatGPT, to give everyone the
            possibilty to start relating to this techonological tsunami, so I
            realised: wouldn't it be great to do something similar for the world
            of meditation?
          </p>

          <p>
            A lot of the tools are already there, but still far from mainstream.
            They are in the hands of people with a techinal background, like me,
            but still far from mainstream.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is already possible and frankly quite easy to generate unlimited
            guided meditations based on any criteria we like, using any voice we
            like. It is also already possible to enlist an ai assistant to give
            us guidance, at times surprisingly accurate and profound.
          </p>

          <p>
            To make this available to everyone (not just the geeks) I've decided
            to create AIMLab: a creative lab, a playground to allow everyone to
            both experiment with these technology and share feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is undeniable a new and unusual frontier for the contemplative
            world, that historically has been so tied to tradition, authority,
            and deep humanity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still, we have been able to adapt and evolve, and the existence and
            populatiy of the many meditation apps today is a proof that we are
            catching up with the modern world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Compared with traditional ways to relate to meditation, AIMLab has
            something quite unusual: a desire to empower and even perhaps
            democratise it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've fell in love with the contemplative world more than a decade
            ago. In my wide exploration during this decade I soon realised the
            need for me to be exclectic, explorative, and adaptive. To integrate
            the wisdom and techniques from ancient tradition into my life, my
            personal values, my unique contemporary needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            And so to me, thinking creatively about contemplative practice comes
            very natural.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may be a minority, perhaps a minority of trailblazers, but if you
            are like me, if you like to explore and be creative, you'll find
            yourself at home in AIMLab.
          </p>

          <h1>AIMlab and SoundGlade</h1>

          <p>
            Although my main drive for setting up AIM Lab is my passion and
            curiosity, it's important I clarify that I'm not setting it up as
            charity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead I see AIMLab as the free, open-source, community-based
            branch of SoundGlade, my own solopreneur business.
          </p>

          <p>
            To navigate the sensitive interplay between free and for-profit I've
            decided to make AIM Lab entirely open and transparent:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the code is open source and any one can inspect it, clone it, or
              run it on their machine
            </li>
            <li>the community is open and hosted on Reddit</li>
            <li>
              all the content generated on the platform is public-first and
              visible to everyone
            </li>
          </ul>
        </>
      }
    />
  );
}
