Hi there,
This blog post will show you how to create meditations, combining AI chatbots with the custom tools offered by AIMlab.

This is a practical article. For more info you can also read more about **what is AIMlab and why I created it**, and also check out some **practical creative examples**.

Let's begin!

### The basic method

It may be useful to start by explaining the basic method. It's very simple: use AI chatbots such as ChatGPT to creatively generate a bespoke meditation script, then simply copy the script in our free Meditatation Composer, et voila, you have a customised high-quality guided meditation that you can play, download or share as you like.

Actually, most of these experiments require a third step: gather creative sources for inspiration. Chatbots have already baked in lots of knowledge about meditative traditions, but they may lack details, particularly about less known meditative style. So sourcing and providing them content (such as books, talks, or other meditation scripts for inspiration) is also going to be an important step.

In a nutshell:
1 Gather inspiration
2 Generate and refine with chatbot
3 Synthesize with Meditation Composer

I'll guide you first through the simplest example of generating a guided meditation, then expand on that offering more creative uses.

### Generating a script with ChatGPT

The simplest use case is to just start with ChatGPT (or any other AI chatbot). Chatbots are very clever at generating text. So you can simply ask them to create a meditation script for you, including the length, the topic, and the methodologies.

Feel to explore all variations. You can be very creative. But for simplicity, you can start with a prompt such as:

> Generate a meditation script for a 10mn guided meditation.

It's really as simple as that!

> [example here - summary that is togglable]

### Pauses

Except, there is an extra important step I recommend: ask it to refine the script further by adding proper **pauses markers**.

> Add pause markers in the format [pause for xx seconds]

The meditation composer supports pause markers. You don't have to worry too much about the format (how you spell it) because it's smart enough to understand, no matter how you write them.

For now the Meditation Composer only supports precise length for pauses. So if you script says something like "allow a 1-2 minutes pause" the composer will decide a precise length for you. In the future I'm considering improving this to allow flexibile pauses, so that the Meditation Player could allow you to customize the length further at the moment of play.

Here is the script refined

### The Meditation Composer

Wonderful! Now, the only thing left to do is to copy that script, open up the Meditation Composer, paste it, chose a voice, and let it do it's job.

Some more info about the composer.

1. Right now there are only two **voices** available, but it's likely I'm going to expand that further, perhaps even allowing you to pick any voice you like from voice libraries (such as from ElevenLabs)

2. We are using AI to process you script and create a structured version, with precise text, pauses and headings. Sometimes the AI gets it wrong! **Review** it's interpretation before launching the final step. The only way to edit a draft is to go back and change the script source you are providing. Experiment with editing the original script and see what happens. We definetely need better editing features, and I'm hoping to introduce them soon.

3. Unless you complete the whole flow nothing will be saved, and if you close the dialog you'll lose the script and have to start from scratch. Once you complete synthesizing a meditation thought the meditation is saved and always available.

_Important: all meditations are public! Don't send any private information in your meditations!_

## The Meditation Player

Once you have finished creating a meditation you can now play it. The Meditation Player is fascinating in itself, and contains something innovative: although it looks like a normal media player, it also shows the meditation script used, and you can jump at any given time in the meditation by tapping on a specific part of the script.

You can also download the meditation, share it, or (if you are the creator) delete it.

Remember that all meditations are public and shared with others! You can delete it if the experiment didn't work out as expected or for any reason it's not in a shareable state.

Ok, so we just created our first meditation! Here is how the daily meditation looks like in the Meditation Player.

## Adding sources of inspirations

Now that I showed you the simplest use case I'm going to show you how to go a step further, ad unlock new possibilities by guiding your chatbot with sources of inspirations.

The possibilities are endless:

- you can generate a meditation starting from another meditation script and "remix" it
- you can use a talk from YouTube or a podcast as a source of inspiration
- you can even take pictures of your view right now (or a picture of artwork) and generate guided open-eye contemplations
- you can provide entire books to the chatbot and generate meditations that follow that particular style

These are just some examples, and I'm sure you'll come up with new, even more interesting methods.

Let's see how to achieve some of this in practice

## How to "remix" a meditation you like

It's possible and quite easy to create new guided meditations based on other meditations.

The tricky bit may be to find a way to obtain a text-version of the meditation you want to remix.

I'm considering building a specific tool that allows you to simply play the meditation, and it'd create a transcript for you. If you find this idea interesting do let me know.

For now thought, we have to find alternative methods.

If the meditation is in a YouTube video you can easily copy the transcript from there.

If you are not sure how to do this, ask your favourite ChatBot. I personally use this Chrome Extension to simplify the process.

Once you have the script, you can start a new chat in your chatbot, attach the script, and ask it to generate the meditation you like.

For example

> I attach the transcript of a meditation I like. Can you re-write this as meditation script? Make sure you also add pause marks in a format such as [pause for xx seconds].

The chatbot will create for you replica of the original meditation as a script.

Now you can start to customize it ("remix it") as you like.\
Some interesting examples:

> Can you rewrite it by doubling it's length? Expand both the guidance and the length of pauses.

> Can you rewrite it in first person, as if it's read as a form of self affirmation?

> Can you rewrite it by removing the introduction and extending the central part?

Sky's the limit!

# How to generate meditations based on talks, books, or pictures

You can expand the method I showed you with all sorts of sources:

- you can copy the transcript of particular talk from YouTube and ask a chatbot to create a meditation that capture the essence of what's bien said (extra tip: ask it to stay as close as possible to the original words used in the talk)
- you can provide it an entire book (if you can find it's source in a pdf or other downloadable formats) and ask it to generate meditations based on those teachings and methods
- you can even just snap a photo and ask it to generate an open-eyed meditation based on that photo (snap-to-meditation!)

If you are curious, I wrote another post full of these examples.

I briefly touched upon this, but if you have any questions feel free to ask.

You can always use the Feedback form to leave me a message.

# Final recap

And that's all for now! I hope these simple instructions are enough to give you a start. As you may have noticed, it's all still quite experimental. If you like to get dirty and play with these different tools and method I'm sure you'll discover something interesting.

Feel free to share any interesting bits you found with the community.

So, to recap, the foundamental method to create customised guided meditations is:

1. gather source of inspirations
2. use a chatbot to create and refine a script (don't forget to add pauses!)
3. use the Meditation Composer flow to synthesize a playable version

Enjoy!
