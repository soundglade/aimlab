Hi there,
In this blog post I'm going to list some experiments I've recently tested. The idea is to inspire you to try your own experiments and share some questions and reflections along the way.

(For a more practical look at how to create your own meditatations you can check out this post intead. Also, I wrote another more generic post about what is AIMLab and why I createdit)

There is a wide range of possibilities. Each one of these experients is really opening up a whole category of explorations. I'm going to explore creating a 10 minutes daily meditation, remix existing meditations you like, write precise ones based on books or talks, write a whole series of meditations with an arch and intention, and some extra creative ways to generate meditations based on photos or to contemplate artwork.

### Daily guided meditations in your favourite style

The easiest and simplest way is to start straight from a chatbot.

> Generate a meditation script for a 10mn daily guided meditation in the style of Sam Harris's Waking Up app. Add pause markers in the format [pause for xx seconds]

It's really as simple as that!
Here is the script I've got and the final playable meditation.
