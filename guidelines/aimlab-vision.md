# AIM Lab: The AI Meditation Petri Dish

## What is AIM Lab?

AIM Lab (https://aimlab.soundglade.com) is an open source website and experimental space exploring the intersection of **AI and meditation**. It is a **public-first laboratory** where ideas are tested, insights are gathered, and failures are expected.

AIM Lab is supported by **SoundGlade**, which funds its development and benefits from the insights generated here. The goal is to **discover what works (and what doesn't) in AI-powered meditation**, fostering creativity, discussion, and exploration in this evolving space.

## Core Principles

- **Experimental playground**, not a finished product or commercial service
- **Fully public and transparent** - everything created here is shared openly
- **Independent but funded by SoundGlade**, which gains insights but does not commercialize AIM Lab
- **Evolving platform** that changes as new ideas are tested
- **Built on playfulness, transparency, and openness**

## In Essence

AIM Lab is a place to ask, **"What happens when AI meets meditation?"** and let the experiments provide the answers - a space for play, curiosity, and open-ended exploration without predefined outcomes.
