# AIM Lab Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

AIM Lab embraces a minimalist, airy aesthetic that reflects its experimental nature as an "AI meditation petri dish." This document outlines the foundational principles that define the AIM Lab experience.

## Visual Design

### Floating Aesthetic

- **Center gravity:** Content floats in the center rather than being anchored top-to-bottom
- **Visual lightness:** UI elements feel weightless and unobtrusive
- **Generous whitespace:** Creates a sense of openness and calm

### Laboratory-Inspired Design

- **Experimental nature:** Honest about its work-in-progress, sometimes "glitchy" character
- **Clean simplicity:** Reflects the laboratory concept through uncluttered design
- **Content-first approach:** Prioritizes meditation experiments over structural elements

### Minimal Structure

- **Reduced navigation:** Avoids heavy navigation elements that anchor the page
- **Contextual UI:** Introduces elements only when necessary
- **Absence of containment:** Content isn't enclosed by obvious boundaries

## What to Embrace

- **Floating navigation:** Subtle, contextual elements that appear when needed
- **Progressive disclosure:** Revealing features gradually as users engage
- **Breathing space:** Generous spacing that enhances the floating quality
- **Minimal footer:** Light, unobtrusive footer (if needed)

## What to Avoid

- **Fixed navbars/footers:** Heavy elements that anchor the page
- **Three-part vertical structure:** The conventional sky (navbar) / content / earth (footer) pattern
- **Dense information displays:** Cluttered layouts with multiple elements
- **Conventional web patterns:** Cookie-cutter website templates and navigation systems
- **Boxed content containers:** Obvious boundaries around content areas

## Content Style

- **Keep it simple:** Focus on essential information
- **Gentle language:** Use mindful language that invites rather than demands
- **Minimal text:** Keep copy purposeful and concise
- **Supportive tone:** Write with a calm, supportive voice

## Adapting for Growth

As AIM Lab evolves:

- Add only the minimum structure needed for usability
- Maintain the central floating quality as features expand
- Question whether new elements support the experimental, laboratory-like feel
