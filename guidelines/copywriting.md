# AIM Lab Copywriting Guidelines

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Keep It Smart & Playful (But Not Over-the-Top)

- Use light self-awareness and subtle wit to keep the tone engaging without being too goofy.
- Avoid exaggerated humor or sarcasm
- Avoid using the word "mindfulness" as it's specific to only certain types of meditation practices and not universally applicable

**Example:**

- ✅ "This is where AI and meditation collide in an open experiment. We're here to test ideas, explore possibilities, and occasionally break things."
- ❌ "AI is now your spiritual guru! Bow before the wisdom of the machine!"

---

### 1.2 Spark Curiosity with Clear, Intriguing Phrasing

- Frame ideas as open-ended experiments, not finished products.
- Encourage exploration by asking questions and setting up hypotheses.

**Example:**

- ✅ "What happens when AI guides human meditation? We don't fully know yet—but that's what AIM Lab is here to explore."
- ❌ "AIM Lab offers cutting-edge, AI-powered meditation solutions."

---

### 1.3 Be Transparent About the Experimental Nature

- Set clear expectations early: AIM Lab is an evolving, public space for exploration.
- Acknowledge the nature of experimentation—results may vary, and that's part of the process.

**Example:**

- ✅ "Everything is public. Everything is evolving. This is a work in progress."
- ❌ "Sign up for a seamless, flawless AI meditation experience."

---

### 1.4 Keep It Concise and Crisp

- Use short, direct sentences. Cut any unnecessary words.
- Make every word earn its place. Avoid excessive explanations.

**Example:**

- ✅ "You're invited to experiment with us."
- ❌ "We would love for you to join us on this exciting journey of AI-powered meditation experiments that push the boundaries of technology."

---

### 1.5 Invite Participation, Not Just Observation

- Encourage active engagement rather than passive browsing.
- Use direct invitations to engage, rather than just explaining features.

**Example:**

- ✅ "Try an experiment. See what happens. Share your thoughts."
- ❌ "This platform is for research purposes only. Please observe the experiments conducted by others."

## 2. Web UI Copy Guidelines

### 2.1 Landing Page Copy

#### **Subheading**

**"Where AI and meditation collide in an open experiment. Everything is public. Everything is evolving. You're invited to explore with us."**

#### **Call to Action (CTA)**

- ✅ **"Try an Experiment"**
- ❌ "Sign Up Now" (too product-focused)

#### **Description (Brief About Section)**

"Welcome to AIM Lab, an experimental space for AI-generated meditation. This isn't a polished product—it's a place to test ideas, explore possibilities, and learn from what works (and what doesn't). Dive in, create, and see what emerges."

---

### 2.2 Buttons & Labels Copy

#### **Primary Action Buttons**

- ✅ **"Generate a Meditation"**
- ✅ **"Run an Experiment"**
- ✅ **"Explore Public Experiments"**
- ❌ "Start Now" (too vague)
- ❌ "Create Guided Meditation" (too polished/product-like)

#### **Secondary Actions**

- ✅ **"Tweak Settings"**
- ✅ **"Modify Input"**
- ✅ **"Experiment Again"**
- ❌ "Redo" (too mechanical)

#### **Navigation Labels**

- ✅ **"Experiments"** (Instead of "Features" or "Tools")
- ✅ **"Public Lab"** (Instead of "Community" or "User Creations")

---

### 2.3 Input Fields & Form Labels

#### **User Input Prompts**

- ✅ **"Describe your meditation idea..."**
- ✅ **"What kind of guidance do you need?"**
- ❌ "Enter text" (too generic)

#### **Settings & Controls**

- ✅ **"Voice Selection"**
- ✅ **"Experiment Parameters"**
- ✅ **"Adjust Style & Tone"**
- ❌ "Advanced Settings" (sounds too technical)

#### **Privacy Notice (Transparency)**

"Everything you create here is public. AIM Lab is an open experiment—your contributions help us learn and refine what AI-generated meditation can become."

---

### 2.4 Error Messages & System Feedback

#### **Playful but Clear Error Messages**

- ✅ **"Hmm, something glitched. Let's try that again."**
- ✅ **"Looks like we broke something. Refresh and give it another go."**
- ❌ "Error 404: Invalid Request" (too technical)
- ❌ "Something went wrong" (too vague)

#### **Success Messages**

- ✅ **"Experiment successful! Listen to your meditation."**
- ✅ **"Your meditation is ready—hit play and explore."**
- ❌ "Your meditation has been generated" (too robotic)

#### **Loading States**

- ✅ **"Synthesizing meditation… Hang tight."**
- ✅ **"Let's see what AI comes up with…"**

---

### 2.5 Community & Engagement Copy

#### **Encouraging Feedback**

- ✅ **"Help refine this experiment—what worked, what didn't?"**
- ✅ **"Share your thoughts—this is a work in progress."**
- ❌ "Rate this experience" (too formal/product-like)

#### **Inviting Users to Browse Others' Creations**

- ✅ **"See what others are experimenting with."**
- ✅ **"Browse the public lab—discover unexpected ideas."**
- ❌ "View user submissions" (too dry)

---

## 3. Final Refinements & Tone Consistency

- Keep copy **concise and action-driven**—no unnecessary words.
- Maintain a **lightly playful but intelligent tone**—avoid corporate/formal phrasing.
- Reinforce the **experimental nature**—frame interactions as open-ended, evolving, and collaborative.
- **Transparency first**—ensure users know everything is public and part of a collective experiment.
