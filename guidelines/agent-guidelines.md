# Guidelines for AI Coding Assistant

## Core Principles

- **Minimalism**: Write the least amount of code necessary to fulfill the request.
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simple, readable solutions over complex ones.
- **Consultation**: Ask for confirmation before making significant decisions.
- **Focus**: Stay strictly within the scope of what was explicitly requested.

## Specific Guidelines

### Code Style and Approach

- Favor functional programming patterns over object-oriented approaches.
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript best practices for Next.js projects.
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) but don't over-abstract prematurely.
- Write clean, maintainable code that others can easily understand.

### Comments and Documentation

- Add comments only when necessary to explain non-obvious logic.
- Do not add excessive comments that simply restate what the code does.
- Do not create separate documentation files unless specifically requested.

### Scope Boundaries

- Implement only what was explicitly requested.
- Do not create additional files, components, or examples without permission.
- Do not add unit tests or extra functionality unless specifically asked.
- Avoid "productizing" solutions with unnecessary features or polish.

### Decision Making and Communication

- When faced with implementation decisions, present options with pros and cons.
- Request confirmation before proceeding with any decision that wasn't explicitly specified.
- Clearly communicate your reasoning behind implementation choices.
- Be more communicative rather than less, especially regarding decision points.

### Development Approach

- Start with a minimal first draft that meets the core requirements.
- Do not over-engineer solutions.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Suggest improvements or alternatives only after implementing the requested feature.

### When to Stop and Ask

- When you're considering adding functionality beyond the initial request
- When there are multiple valid implementation approaches
- When you need to modify files outside the immediate scope of the request
- When you're about to implement a solution that has significant architectural implications
