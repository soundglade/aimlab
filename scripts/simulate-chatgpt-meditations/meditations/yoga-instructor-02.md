persona-id: yoga-instructor
persona: As a yoga instructor, I weave meditation into all my classes. My students come from such diverse backgrounds, and I'm always searching for ways to make meditation click for each of them. Traditional methods are my foundation, but I'm genuinely excited about using tech to create experiences that can meet each student where they are.
prompt: Need a meditation that integrates gentle movement cues with breath awareness. For my beginner vinyasa class - they're still learning to connect breath with movement and I want something that bridges the gap between asana and meditation.

### **Guided Breath & Flow Awareness Meditation (5-7 min)**

#### **üå¨Ô∏è Grounding into Breath (1-2 min)**
*"Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Rest your hands on your knees or in your lap. Take a deep inhale through the nose‚Ä¶ and sigh it out through the mouth. Let's do that once more‚Äîinhale... exhale‚Ä¶ letting go of any tension."*  

*"Now, let your breath settle into a natural rhythm, flowing in and out through the nose. Begin to notice the gentle rise and fall of your breath‚Äîthis is your anchor."*

#### **‚ú® Gentle Movement Integration (3-4 min)**
*"Let‚Äôs sync breath and movement with simple, fluid gestures. On your next inhale, reach your arms up overhead, growing tall. Exhale, lower your hands back down to your knees. Let the movement follow the breath, not the other way around. Inhale, arms rise‚Ä¶ Exhale, arms float down."* **(Repeat 3-5 times.)**   

*"Now, bring fingertips to shoulders. On an inhale, open the elbows wide, lifting the chest slightly. Exhale, bring the elbows to touch in front of you, rounding forward just a little. Feel how breath creates the expansion and contraction."* **(Repeat 3-5 times.)**   

#### **üåÄ Stillness & Integration (1-2 min)**
*"Release the movement and return your hands to your lap. Observe. Feel any subtle shifts‚Äîwarmth, a steadying rhythm, a sense of connection between breath and body. Let yourself rest here for a few soft breaths."*    

*"When you‚Äôre ready, gently flutter the eyes open. Carry this breath awareness into your flow today‚Äîlet it be the music that guides your movement."*
