persona: After 15 years of traditional meditation practice, I still find myself curious about new approaches. The tech world has always fascinated me, and I'm genuinely interested in seeing how AI might complement the ancient practices I've come to know so well. I enjoy thoughtfully experimenting with different methods and sharing what I learn with others.
prompt: non-dual awareness practice with bell intervals

### **Non-Dual Awareness with Bell Intervals**  
This practice uses periodic bell sounds to facilitate direct recognition of awareness itself. The bells act as gentle reminders to return to the present moment and dissolve into pure consciousness.

#### **How to Practice**  
1. **Set an Intention** – Begin with the understanding that you're not seeking an altered state but recognizing the awareness that is already present.  

2. **Use a Bell Timer** – Utilize a meditation timer (apps like *Insight Timer*, *Enso*, or a simple interval timer) to set bells at chosen intervals, such as every 3 to 10 minutes.  

3. **Rest in Awareness** – Instead of concentrating or manipulating experience, simply remain open and aware without any effort. Let thoughts, sensations, and emotions arise and dissolve naturally.  

4. **Bell as a Returning Point** – Each time a bell sounds, gently check:  
   - Who or what is aware?  
   - Is there an observer separate from the experience?  
   - Does awareness change between bell sounds?  
   - Rest in that knowing.  

5. **Let Awareness Be Naturally Present** – No need to manufacture a state. The bell simply reminds you to notice that awareness has always been here.  

6. **Closing the Practice** – After the final bell, take a few breaths and gently transition out of practice while carrying this awareness into everyday life.  

### **Why It Works**  
- **Interrupts Identification with Thoughts** – The bell serves as a micro-reset, breaking unconscious mental loops.  
- **Encourages Effortless Awareness** – You’re invited to rest in what is already present rather than striving for an experience.  
- **Bridges Meditation & Daily Life** – Periodic reminders help integrate non-dual awareness beyond formal practice.
