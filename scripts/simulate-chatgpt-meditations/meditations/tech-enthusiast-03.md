persona: Everything I know about meditation, I learned from Reddit and YouTube - been at it for about 2 years now. Working in IT means I spend a lot of time thinking about how things work, and meditation is no different. Really stoked about open-source projects that let us experiment with AI and meditation!
prompt: I want to try meditating but not sure where to start. Maybe something simple?

### **Basic Mindfulness Meditation (5-10 minutes to start)**  
1. **Find a quiet spot** – Sit comfortably in a chair or on the floor.  
2. **Set a timer** – Start with 5-10 minutes. No pressure to go longer.  
3. **Close your eyes** (if comfortable) and bring your attention to your breath.  
4. **Breathe naturally** – No need to control it; just observe.  
5. **Notice sensations** – Feel the air moving in and out of your nose, or your stomach rising and falling.  
6. **Expect distractions** – If your mind wanders (which it will), gently bring it back to your breath.  
7. **Repeat** – Keep coming back to the breath each time your mind drifts.
