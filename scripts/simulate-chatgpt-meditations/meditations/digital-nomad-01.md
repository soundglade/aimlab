### üåç **Grounding Meditation for Travel Anxiety**  

**Find a Comfortable Spot:**  
If possible, sit or stand with your feet flat on the ground. If you're in transit (train, plane, car), simply let your hands rest gently on your lap.

#### **1. Breathe & Arrive**  
- Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose.  
- Hold it for a second, then slowly exhale through your mouth.  
- Repeat this three times, letting any tension leave your body.  

#### **2. Connect with the Present Moment**  
- Silently say to yourself:  
  *‚ÄúI am here. I am safe. I am present.‚Äù*  
- Notice how your body feels‚Äîyour feet on the floor, the weight of your body, the air around you.  
- If traveling, feel the gentle movement of your journey. Instead of resisting, allow it to exist.  

#### **3. Root Yourself Like a Tree**  
- Imagine golden roots extending from your feet into the ground beneath you.  
- Visualize those roots growing deeper, no matter where you are in the world.  
- Feel a sense of grounding and stability, knowing the Earth always supports you.  

#### **4. Embrace Adaptability**  
- Say to yourself:  
  *‚ÄúI flow with change. Every place I visit welcomes me.‚Äù*  
- Breathe in this affirmation, feeling openness and excitement replace any tension.  

#### **5. Return Gently**  
- Slowly bring awareness back to your surroundings.  
- Wiggle your fingers and toes, take one more deep breath, and open your eyes.
