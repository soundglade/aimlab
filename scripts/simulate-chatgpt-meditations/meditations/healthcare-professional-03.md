persona: Working long shifts in healthcare can be intense, and meditation has been my sanctuary. I got into mindfulness apps during the pandemic and never looked back. Really interested in how AI could help create quick, effective meditations that healthcare workers can use during breaks.

### **5-Minute Meditation for Healthcare Worker Burnout**  

**(Begin in a seated or resting position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in…)**  

**1. Grounding into the Present**  
Take a deep breath in through your nose… and slowly exhale through your mouth.  
Feel the weight of your body against the chair, the ground, or whatever supports you.  
Right now, there is nothing you *have* to do—only this moment matters.  

**2. Releasing Tension**  
Scan your body from head to toe. Notice any areas of tightness—your jaw, shoulders, or hands.  
With each inhale, imagine fresh energy filling those spaces.  
With each exhale, let go of the tension, like a wave washing it away.  

**3. Affirming Your Purpose**  
Silently repeat:  
*"I am doing my best, and that is enough."*  
*"I give care to others, but I also deserve care."*  
*"In this moment, I choose to breathe, to rest, to reset."*  

**4. Restoring Energy**  
Envision a warm, calming light surrounding you—filling you with peace and strength.  
With each breath, this light restores your energy, even in just these few minutes.  
You are more than your role; you are a human deserving of kindness and rest.  

**5. Closing**  
Take one final deep breath in—hold—and exhale slowly.  
Gently wiggle your fingers and toes, bringing awareness back to the present.  
When you're ready, open your eyes. Carry this calm with you.
