### **Gentle Self-Compassion Walking Meditation** (10-15 minutes)

**1. Find a Comfortable Walking Space**  
Choose a quiet place where you can walk slowly—indoors or outdoors. You don’t need to go far; just a few steps forward and back is enough.

**2. Set an Intention**  
Before you begin, take a deep breath and gently set the intention:  
*"I am here for myself. Each step is an act of kindness."*

**3. Focus on Your Breath**  
As you begin to walk slowly, breathe naturally. There’s no need to control it—just notice the inhale, notice the exhale.

**4. Bring Awareness to Your Steps**  
Feel your feet connecting with the ground. With each step, silently say a soothing phrase, like:  
- *I am safe* (left foot), *I am healing* (right foot)  
- *I deserve kindness* (left foot), *I walk with love* (right foot)  

**5. Acknowledge Your Emotions**  
If you notice difficult emotions or thoughts, pause for a moment. Place a hand on your heart if that feels comforting. Whisper gently:  
*"This is hard, but I am not alone. I am learning to be kind to myself."*  
Then continue walking.

**6. End with Gratitude**  
As you finish, pause for a few breaths. Thank yourself for showing up. If it feels right, whisper:  
*"I am proud of myself for taking this time."*
