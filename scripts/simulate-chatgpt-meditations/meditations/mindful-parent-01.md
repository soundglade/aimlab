persona-id: mindful-parent
persona: Raising three kids while maintaining a meditation practice has been quite the journey! I started with simple mindfulness apps but found myself wanting more flexible options that could adapt to the chaos of family life. Pretty comfortable with tech (have to be with teens in the house!) and excited about AI-customized meditation that works around family schedules.
prompt: super quick meditation for busy parents

### **1-Minute Reset for Parents**  
1. **Get Comfortable:** Sit or stand, wherever you are.  
2. **Deep Breath In (4 sec):** Inhale deeply through your nose.  
3. **Hold (2 sec):** Let the air settle, pausing calmly.  
4. **Slow Exhale (6 sec):** Release stress as you breathe out through your mouth.  
5. **Quick Body Scan (10 sec):** Notice any tension (jaw, shoulders, back) and soften it.  
6. **Mini Mantra (10 sec):** Silently repeat a phrase like _"I am present. I am patient."_  
7. **Closing Breath (5 sec):** One deep inhale and slow exhale to seal it in.
