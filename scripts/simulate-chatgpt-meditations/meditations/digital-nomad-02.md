### **5-Minute Moving Meditation: "Flow with the Journey"**  

1. **Settle In (30 sec)**  
   - Sit comfortably with your back supported.  
   - Rest your hands on your lap or thighs.  
   - Gently close your eyes or soften your gaze.

2. **Sync with Motion & Breath (1 min)**  
   - Notice the natural movement of the plane or train—its vibrations, the subtle sways.  
   - Inhale deeply through your nose for **four counts**.  
   - Exhale slowly through your mouth for **six counts**.  
   - Repeat, letting each breath ground you in the present moment.

3. **Sensory Awareness (2 min)**  
   - Tune into **sounds**—the hum of the engine, distant voices, or the rustle of fabric.  
   - Feel **sensations**—air against your skin, the weight of your body in the seat.  
   - Observe **sights** (if eyes are open)—clouds, landscapes passing by.  
   - Accept it all without judgment.

4. **Embrace the Journey (1 min)**  
   - Say silently: _"I am moving, yet I am present."_  
   - Visualize yourself flowing effortlessly, like a river adapting to its path.  
   - Keep breathing naturally, letting go of stress with each exhale.

5. **Gently Return (30 sec)**  
   - Wiggle your fingers and toes.  
   - Open your eyes and take in your surroundings with fresh awareness.
