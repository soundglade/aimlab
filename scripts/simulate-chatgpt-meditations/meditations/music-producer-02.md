persona: Making music and meditating go hand in hand for me. I've been experimenting with different meditation soundscapes in my home studio, and the intersection of AI, meditation, and audio is fascinating. Looking forward to exploring how technology can create more immersive meditation experiences.
prompt: Looking for a meditation that works with sound awareness. Something that helps train the ear while also being mindful - thinking about using it as a warm-up before studio sessions.

### **Sound Awareness Meditation**

### **1. Settling In (2-3 Minutes)**
- Find a comfortable spot in your studio with minimal distractions.
- Close your eyes and take slow, deep breaths, letting your body relax.
- Set an intention: "I am fully present with sound."

### **2. Expanding Awareness to Ambient Sounds (5 Minutes)**
- Begin by simply listening to the sounds around you—without judgment.
- Notice distant sounds (outside your studio), then shift to closer ones.
- Focus on the layers of sound: their texture, rhythm, and movement.

### **3. Focused Listening Exercise (5-7 Minutes)**
- Choose a consistent, subtle sound (a fan, a soft synth pad, or a field recording).
- Isolate one aspect—its pitch, overtones, or movement.
- After a minute, shift focus to a different layer or sonic aspect.
- If thoughts drift, gently return to the sound.

### **4. Toning or Vocalization (Optional - 3 Minutes)**
- Hum a note that resonates with you.
- Feel the vibrations and how they interact with the space.
- Observe harmonics or resonance naturally emerging.

### **5. Returning to Silence (2-3 Minutes)**
- Gradually move from active listening to noticing silence.
- Feel the contrast between sound and space.
- Open your eyes and carry this heightened auditory awareness into your session.
