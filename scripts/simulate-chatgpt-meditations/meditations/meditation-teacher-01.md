persona: I've been teaching meditation for 8 years now, primarily working with beginners at local community centers. While I deeply value traditional practices, I'm quite intrigued by how AI could help personalize the experience for my students - everyone's journey is different, after all. I'm pretty active on Reddit's meditation forums and love discovering innovative ways to share mindfulness with others.
prompt: Write a meditation script incorporating shamatha and vipassana techniques, with space for silence between instructions. Looking for something suitable for a mixed-level group that gradually progresses from focused attention to open awareness over 25 minutes.

### **Guided Meditation: From Focus to Spacious Awareness (25 Minutes)**  

**[Opening – 2 min]**  
_Settle in with a relaxed but alert posture. Allow the body to be at ease._  

**Instructor:**  
Take a moment to arrive. Feel the weight of your body resting on the chair or cushion, grounded and supported. Gently close your eyes, or lower your gaze. Begin by noticing the natural rhythm of your breath—no need to control it, just observe.  
 
(10 seconds of silence)  

Softly scan your body from head to toe, releasing any tension. Let go of the day’s momentum, inviting stillness.  

(15 seconds of silence)

### **Phase 1: Shamatha – Anchoring Attention (10 min)**  

**Instructor:**  
Now, bring your attention to the breath as it moves in and out. You might notice the coolness at the nostrils, the expansion in the belly, or the rising and falling of the chest. Choose a point of focus and rest your awareness there.  

(30 seconds of silence)  

If the mind wanders, that’s natural. Each time you notice it, gently return to the breath, without judgment. Think of your attention like a feather resting on the breath—light, steady, present.  

(60 seconds of silence)  

As you continue, notice the breath from beginning to end—each inhale, each exhale. Stay curious, as if you’re experiencing it for the first time.  

(2 minutes of silence)  

If distractions arise, acknowledge them kindly. Label them—“thinking,” “feeling,” “hearing”—and then return to the breath. This is the practice: noticing and returning, again and again.  

(4 minutes of silence)  

Now, let go of any effort. Simply rest in the breath, allowing it to happen naturally.  

(2 minutes of silence)

### **Phase 2: Vipassana – Expanding Awareness (12 min)**  

**Instructor:**  
Now, widen your focus beyond the breath. Open your awareness to all sensations, sounds, and thoughts, noticing them as they arise and pass.  

(30 seconds of silence)  

Instead of fixating on any one experience, observe everything as part of a flowing stream—sensations in the body, the hum of distant sounds, even thoughts passing through the mind like clouds. Just witness, without grasping or pushing anything away.  

(2 minutes of silence)  

See if you can rest in this open space—aware, yet at ease. Not needing to fix or change anything, just noticing.  

(3 minutes of silence)  

If a strong sensation or thought arises, simply label it—“warmth,” “tension,” “thinking”—and let it move on. Stay open to each new moment as it unfolds.  

(3 minutes of silence)  

Now, rest in pure awareness itself—aware of being aware. Nothing to do. Just presence.  

(3 minutes of silence)
