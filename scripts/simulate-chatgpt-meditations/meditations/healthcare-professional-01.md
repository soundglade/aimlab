persona: Working long shifts in healthcare can be intense, and meditation has been my sanctuary. I got into mindfulness apps during the pandemic and never looked back. Really interested in how AI could help create quick, effective meditations that healthcare workers can use during breaks.

### **3-Minute Reset: A Mindful Pause for Healthcare Workers**  

#### *Find a place where you can sit comfortably. Close your eyes or soften your gaze.*  

### **Minute 1: Breathe & Release**  
Take a deep breath in through your nose… and slowly exhale through your mouth.  
Again, inhale deeply… feel your belly expand… and exhale, releasing tension.  
With each breath, let go of the stress from your shift.  

### **Minute 2: Anchor in the Present**  
Gently bring your focus to your body. Feel the steady ground beneath you.  
Notice the rhythm of your breath.  
If your mind races, that’s okay—just return to the inhale… and exhale.  
Remind yourself: *I am here. I am present. I am enough.*  

### **Minute 3: Recharge & Return**  
Picture a warm light filling your body with a sense of calm and renewal.  
Take one more deep breath in—hold it—and exhale fully.  
Wiggle your fingers and toes, gently bring movement back.  
When you’re ready, open your eyes and step back into your shift, refreshed.
