persona: Between client meetings and project deadlines, meditation has become my anchor. Standard meditation apps never quite fit my schedule or needs, though. I love checking out new tech, and the idea of crafting meditations that actually work with my crazy schedule sounds perfect. You'll often find me on Reddit looking for ways to optimize both work and wellness.

### **2-Minute Work Stress Meditation**  

1. **Find Stillness (10 seconds):** Sit comfortably with both feet on the ground. Close your eyes or soften your gaze.  

2. **Deep Breaths (30 seconds):**  
   - Inhale deeply through your nose for **4 seconds**.  
   - Hold for **4 seconds**.  
   - Exhale slowly through your mouth for **6 seconds**.  
   - Repeat for three rounds.  

3. **Body Check-In (30 seconds):** Bring awareness to your body. Release tension in your shoulders, jaw, or hands. If you notice tightness, take a deep breath and imagine that tension melting away.  

4. **Focus Shift (30 seconds):** Picture a calm sceneâ€”an open sky, ocean waves, or a peaceful forest. Stay with this image and let your stress fade into the background.  

5. **Set an Intention (20 seconds):** Silently repeat a simple mantra:  
   *"I am calm. I am capable. I move forward with ease."*  

6. **Gentle Return (10 seconds):** Open your eyes, roll your shoulders, and take one last deep breath before continuing your day.
