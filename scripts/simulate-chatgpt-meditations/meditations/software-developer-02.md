persona: Hey there! I'm a software dev who got into meditation through Headspace about three years ago. It's been amazing seeing how meditation has evolved alongside tech, and I've been diving deep into both worlds since then. I spend my days writing code, but I also dedicate time to exploring different meditation techniques. Super excited about using AI to customize meditation - it's like writing a program for your mind!
prompt: Can you write a short meditation for focus while coding?

### **Focused Coding Meditation (5-7 Minutes)**  

**1. Settle In (1 Minute)**  
- Sit comfortably with your back straight, feet grounded, and hands resting on your keyboard or desk.  
- Close your eyes or soften your gaze.  
- Take a deep breath in through your noseâ€¦ and slowly exhale through your mouth.  
- Let tension melt away with each exhale.  

**2. Anchor Your Attention (2 Minutes)**  
- Shift your focus to your breath, feeling it move in and out naturally.  
- Imagine each inhale sharpening your mind, bringing clarity.  
- Each exhale releases distractions, making space for deeper concentration.  
- If thoughts arise about tasks or bugs, acknowledge them, then gently return to your breath.  

**3. Mental Programming (2-3 Minutes)**  
- Silently repeat: *"I code with clarity. My mind is sharp and engaged."*  
- Picture yourself effortlessly navigating your codebase, solving problems with ease.  
- If stuck, envision stepping back, seeing the big picture, then zooming in with fresh insight.  

**4. Transition Back (30 Seconds-1 Minute)**  
- Take one last deep breath, feeling refreshed.  
- Slowly bring awareness back to your screen, your hands on the keyboard.  
- Open your eyes, carrying this focus into your work.
