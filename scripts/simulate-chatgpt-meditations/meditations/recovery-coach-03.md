persona: Supporting people in recovery has shown me how powerful meditation can be. I use various meditation apps with my clients, but everyone's journey is unique. Excited about the potential of AI to create more adaptable meditation experiences that can support different stages of recovery.
prompt: Write a grounding meditation for moments of craving. Should be simple enough to remember and use anywhere, with clear steps for working with difficult emotions as they arise.

### **Grounding Meditation for Moments of Craving**  

#### **1. Pause and Breathe**  
Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly expand. Slowly exhale through your mouth.  
Repeat this three times, letting each breath bring a little more calm.  

#### **2. Name Whatâ€™s Happening**  
Silently say to yourself:  
*"I am experiencing a craving. This is a feeling, not a command."*  
Acknowledge that cravings come and go, like waves in the ocean.  

#### **3. Feel Your Feet on the Ground**  
Press your feet into the floor. Notice how the ground supports you.  
If youâ€™re standing, shift your weight slightly to feel stability in your body.  

#### **4. Engage Your Senses**  
To bring yourself into the present moment, mentally name:  
- **3 things you can see** (colors, shapes, or movement around you)  
- **2 things you can feel** (the air on your skin, fabric on your body)  
- **1 thing you can hear** (a distant sound, your own breath)  

#### **5. Offer Yourself Compassion**  
Place a hand over your heart (if possible) and say to yourself:  
*"It's okay to feel this. I am strong enough to ride this wave."*  

#### **6. Choose the Next Right Step**  
Now, gently ask yourself:  
**What is one small action I can take right now to support my recovery?**  
Maybe it's drinking water, reaching out to someone, or simply taking another deep breath.  

**Remember:** Cravings pass. You are not alone. You have the strength to stay present and grounded in this moment. ðŸ’™
