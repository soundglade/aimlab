persona: Living with a visual impairment, I've always been interested in making meditation more accessible through technology. I use screen readers and various accessibility tools daily, and I'm excited about how AI could help create more inclusive meditation experiences for people with different abilities.
prompt: Can you write a meditation script that doesn't rely on visual cues? Should use clear, directional language and avoid metaphors that assume sight. Include alternative anchors for attention like sound, breath, and body sensation.

### **Guided Meditation for Grounding in the Present Moment**  

Find a comfortable position—either sitting or lying down. Allow your hands to rest naturally, either on your lap, at your sides, or in any way that feels supportive. If you're sitting, keep your back upright but not stiff.    

Take a moment to notice your surroundings through sound. Listen for the most distant sound you can hear. Let it come and go without needing to identify it. Now, shift your focus closer—perhaps to softer sounds around you, like the hum of a device, the air moving in the room, or the subtle sounds of your own breath.  

This meditation will guide you to connect with your breath, body, and the present moment. There’s nothing to achieve—just experience whatever arises.  

**[Breath Awareness]**  
Bring your attention to your breath. Notice where you feel it most clearly. You might feel the cool air at your nostrils as you inhale or the gentle warmth as you exhale. Maybe you sense the rise and fall in your chest or the subtle movement in your belly.  

There’s no need to change anything. Just observe. Breathe in… and breathe out. Feel the rhythm of your breath, steady and natural.  

If your mind wanders, that’s okay. Each time you notice, gently bring your focus back to your breath.  

**[Body Awareness]**  
Now, shift your attention to your body. Start with the points of contact—where your body touches the surface beneath you. Feel the weight of your body pressing down. Notice any warmth, pressure, or softness beneath you.  

Move your awareness to your feet. Sense any tingling, warmth, or coolness. Without moving them, simply notice the way your feet feel.  

Now, bring attention to your hands. Feel where they are resting. Notice any sensations—maybe a slight pulsing, a temperature difference, or just a feeling of presence.  

Gently scan through your body, noticing any areas of tension or ease. There’s no need to judge—just observe.  

**[Anchoring in Sound]**  
Shift your focus back to sound. Without searching, let sounds come to you naturally. Notice the layers—the distant ones, the closer ones, and perhaps even the sound of your own breath.  

If thoughts arise, gently return to listening. Just be with the sounds, letting them come and go, without needing to follow them.  

**[Closing and Transition]**  
Now, bring awareness back to your breath once more. Take a slightly deeper breath in... and a slow breath out.  

Begin to notice the space around you again. If you'd like, gently wiggle your fingers or toes. When you feel ready, bring this sense of awareness with you as you continue your day.  

Your practice is always here whenever you need it.
