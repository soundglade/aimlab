persona: As a yoga instructor, I weave meditation into all my classes. My students come from such diverse backgrounds, and I'm always searching for ways to make meditation click for each of them. Traditional methods are my foundation, but I'm genuinely excited about using tech to create experiences that can meet each student where they are.

### **Savasana Meditation with Pranayama**  

**(Set the Scene)**  
“Lie down comfortably on your mat. Adjust your body so you can fully surrender to the ground beneath you. Let your feet fall open, arms resting gently by your sides, palms facing upward. Close your eyes and take a deep inhale… and exhale completely.”  

_(Pause for a few breaths)_  

**Guided Breath Awareness & Relaxation**  
“Begin to notice your breath as it moves in and out naturally. There’s nothing to force—simply become aware. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest, the soft expansion of your belly.  

Now, bring your awareness to your toes. With each exhale, invite them to relax. Let this wave of relaxation travel through your feet… your ankles… your calves… thighs…hips.  

Feel your spine melt into the mat, tension unwinding from your lower back… middle back… shoulders. Relax your arms, your hands, each finger.  

Release your jaw… soften your forehead… let your entire face relax.”  

_(Pause briefly)_  

**Three-Part Breath (Dirgha Pranayama)**  
"Now, let’s deepen our connection to the breath. Place one hand on your belly, the other on your heart. We’ll practice three-part breathing, filling the belly first, then the ribs, then the chest.  

Take a slow **inhale through your nose**, expanding the belly… then the ribs… then the chest.  

Now, exhale **slowly through your nose**, letting the chest fall… ribs soften… belly emptying completely.  

Again, inhale—belly expands… ribs widen… chest lifts.  
Exhale—chest lowers… ribs contract… belly draws in.  

Continue this breath rhythm, feeling each inhale bring in calm… each exhale letting go of tension.”  

_(Cycle through 3-5 rounds, then return to a natural breath)_  

**Final Stillness & Closing**  
“Now, surrender fully. Trust that your breath is carrying you exactly where you need to be. There is nothing to do, nowhere to be—just this moment of complete presence.  

Allow yourself to rest here … in stillness … in peace.”  

_(Let students rest in silence for a few minutes)_  

“Gently begin to invite movement back into your fingers and toes. When you’re ready, roll to one side, pausing for a breath. Then, press yourself up to a seated position, bringing hands to heart.  

Take a final inhale together… and exhale with gratitude.”  

“Namaste.”
