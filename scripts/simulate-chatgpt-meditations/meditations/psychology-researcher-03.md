persona: As a psychology grad student, I'm fascinated by how meditation affects anxiety levels - it's actually the focus of my research. I practice regularly and I'm really curious about AI's potential in creating more targeted meditation experiences. I try to stay on top of the latest developments in meditation tech and frequently participate in studies combining mindfulness with new technologies.

### **Basic Anxiety-Reduction Meditation for Research Participants**  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**Goal:** To promote relaxation and mindfulness while maintaining a structured, repeatable experience  

#### **Introduction (1 minute)**  
*"Welcome to this short meditation session. This practice is designed to help you relax and center yourself. You don’t need any prior experience—just find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, and gently close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so."*  

#### **Breath Awareness (2-3 minutes)**  
*"Begin by bringing your attention to your breathing. Notice the natural rhythm of your inhale and exhale, without changing anything. Simply observe."*  

*"If it helps, take a slow breath in through your nose… and exhale gently through your mouth. Try this a couple of times, allowing yourself to settle into the moment."*  

#### **Body Scan (2-3 minutes)**  
*"Now, shift your awareness to your body, scanning from head to toe."*  
*"Notice any areas of tension, and see if you can soften them slightly, without forcing anything."*  
*"Feel the weight of your body where you are sitting or lying down."*  

#### **Anchor to the Present (1-2 minutes)**  
*"If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath or the sensations in your body."*  
*"Acknowledge any thoughts that arise, then let them pass like clouds moving across the sky."*  

#### **Closing (1 minute)**  
*"Slowly bring awareness back to your surroundings. Wiggle your fingers and toes, take one last deep breath, and when you're ready, gently open your eyes."*  

*"Thank you for taking this moment for yourself."*
