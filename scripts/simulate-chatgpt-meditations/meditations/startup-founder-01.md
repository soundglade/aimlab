### **Decision Fatigue Reset Meditation (5–10 min)**  

1. **Find Stillness**  
   - Sit comfortably and close your eyes.  
   - Take a deep breath in… and slowly exhale.  
   - Let your shoulders drop and relax.  

2. **Grounding with Breath**  
   - Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of 4.  
   - Hold for 2 seconds.  
   - Exhale slowly through the mouth for 6.  
   - Repeat for a few cycles, letting tension melt away.  

3. **Clarity Visualization**  
   - Imagine your mind as a still lake. Each decision you’ve faced today is a ripple on the surface.  
   - With every breath out, picture the ripples settling, leaving the water calm and clear.  
   - Let go of any urgency—there is time for thoughtful action.  

4. **Anchoring in Intuition**  
   - Silently ask yourself: *What truly matters right now?*  
   - Notice any feelings, insights, or clarity that arise without force.  
   - Return to your breath, knowing that decisions made from a calm mind serve you best.  

5. **Closing with Focus**  
   - Gently wiggle your fingers, reconnecting with the present.  
   - Open your eyes with a renewed sense of perspective.
