persona: Mental health advocacy is my passion, and meditation has been a crucial part of my own journey. I spend quite a bit of time in online wellness communities, sharing experiences and learning from others. I think AI could be a game-changer for making meditation more accessible, especially for folks who find traditional approaches a bit challenging.

**Trauma-Informed Meditation Script for Anxiety**

*Before we begin, find a comfortable and safe space where you can sit or lie down without interruption. This practice is yours, and you have the autonomy to engage with it in a way that feels most supportive to you. If at any point you feel overwhelmed, it's okay to pause, take a break, or stop. Your well-being is the priority here.*

**Grounding in Safety**

Let's start by acknowledging your current environment. You’ve chosen this space because it offers you a sense of safety. Notice the support beneath you, whether that’s the floor beneath your feet, or the chair or surface you’re resting on. This support will remain constant, offering you stability.

Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs gently, and then exhale slowly, letting go of the air more softly than you drew it in. With each exhale, feel yourself releasing tension, knowing it's safe to do so.

**Fostering Choice and Control**

As we move through this practice, remember you're in control. You can choose to engage with my voice as much or as little as you like, or even rest in silence, focusing solely on your breath. This time is for you, and you decide how to navigate it.

**Engaging the Present Moment**

Now, gently bring your attention to the present. Notice any sounds around you, perhaps distant or near, acknowledging them without judgment. Then, bring your focus back to yourself, to your own presence here and now.

Feel the texture of your clothes against your skin, the temperature of the air as it touches you. These sensations anchor you in the now, safe and grounded.

**Breathing with Intention**

With a soft focus, bring your awareness to your breath. Without forcing it to change, observe the natural rhythm of your breathing. Feel the air enter through your nostrils, cool and revitalizing, and warm as you exhale.

If you're comfortable, try to elongate your breaths, inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a moment, and exhaling slowly through your mouth. Each exhale is an opportunity to release more deeply, letting go of anxiety, letting calmness flow in its place.

**Cultivating Compassion and Release**

Imagine a gentle, soothing light surrounding you, embodying compassion, understanding, and peace. With each breath, this light becomes brighter, its warmth more noticeable. It's a symbol of the kindness you deserve, from others and from yourself.

As this session comes to a close, take a moment to thank yourself for this act of self-care. Remember, meditation is a practice, not perfection. Each time you choose to engage in this practice, you're taking a step towards healing and peace.

Whenever you're ready, begin to bring your awareness back to your surroundings, moving your fingers and toes gently, and when you feel comfortable, open your eyes.
