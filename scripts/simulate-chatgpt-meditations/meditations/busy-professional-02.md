persona: Between client meetings and project deadlines, meditation has become my anchor. Standard meditation apps never quite fit my schedule or needs, though. I love checking out new tech, and the idea of crafting meditations that actually work with my crazy schedule sounds perfect. You'll often find me on Reddit looking for ways to optimize both work and wellness.
prompt: Need a 5 min meditation to do between meetings. Something energizing.
