**Urge Surfing Meditation Script**

---

_Begin by finding a comfortable and quiet place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes if that feels comfortable for you, and take three deep, nourishing breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Allow yourself to feel grounded and present in this moment._

_As you begin to settle, bring your attention to your body. Notice any physical sensations that arise, without judgment or the need to change anything. Observe your body with curiosity, paying attention to each part as you continue to breathe deeply and evenly._

_(Pause for 20-30 seconds)_

_Now, gently acknowledge any urges or cravings you are experiencing. You might visualize these urges as waves in the ocean; they rise, peak, and eventually fall._

_Imagine yourself sitting on the shore, watching these waves come and go. Some waves may be larger and more powerful, while others are smaller and less intense. Each wave is unique, but all of them share one thing in commonâ€”they eventually recede._

_When you notice an urge, try to identify where in your body you feel it the most. Is it in your stomach? Your chest? Your throat? Observe the sensation without trying to change it or make it go away. It's okay if it feels uncomfortable or intense; remember, like a wave, it will rise and then fall._

_(Pause for 30 seconds)_

_With each breath, see if you can create a little more space around the urge. You're not trying to push it away; you're simply allowing it to be there, observing it with mindfulness and compassion._

_Remember, you are not your urges. You are the observer, sitting on the shore, watching the waves come and go. These sensations, no matter how strong, are temporary. They will pass._

_(Pause for 20-30 seconds)_

_Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, grounding yourself with each breath. With time and practice, you will find it becomes easier to observe your urges without being swept away by them._

_As this meditation comes to a close, gently begin to bring your attention back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you're ready, open your eyes._

_Remind yourself of your strength and resilience. You have shown great courage by facing your urges directly, surfing the waves as they come, and choosing not to act on them._

_Thank yourself for taking this time to practice mindfulness, for supporting your journey of recovery one breath at a time._
