### **Investor Call Reset Meditation**  
(**Duration:** ~2 minutes)

1. **Find Your Breath (10 sec)**  
   - Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose.  
   - Exhale slowly through your mouth.  

2. **Let Go of Tension (30 sec)**  
   - With each inhale, imagine gathering tension from your body.  
   - With each exhale, feel that tension dissolve—especially from your shoulders, jaw, and hands.  

3. **Center Your Mind (45 sec)**  
   - Silently repeat: **"I am calm. I am clear. I am capable."**  
   - Visualize yourself handling the next conversation with confidence.  
   - Let go of any pressure—just focus on being present.  

4. **Energize & Refocus (30 sec)**  
   - Take one deep, powerful breath in.  
   - As you exhale, open your eyes, stretch lightly, and return feeling refreshed.
