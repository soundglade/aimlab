persona: Creating is my life - it's what I do professionally and personally. Meditation helps me stay focused and tap into my creative flow. I'm pretty particular about customizing everything in my life (you should see my workspace setup!), so the idea of personalized meditation scripts really speaks to me.

### **Quick Inspiration Meditation (5 Minutes)**  

**1. Get Comfortable (30 sec.)**  
Find a quiet space. Sit or lie down comfortably. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in… then exhale slowly.  

**2. Focus on Your Breath (1 min.)**  
Breathe in deeply through your nose… and out through your mouth. With each inhale, imagine fresh energy filling your mind. With each exhale, let go of any mental clutter.  

**3. Tap into Creativity (2 min.)**  
Picture yourself in a beautiful, open space—maybe a sunlit studio, a forest clearing, or a futuristic workspace designed just for you. This is your creative sanctuary.  

A spark ignites in your mind—an idea forming, expanding, evolving. Let thoughts flow freely, without judgment. Colors, sounds, textures—everything is possible here.  

**4. Anchor the Inspiration (1 min.)**  
Now, take one deep breath and mentally **lock in** your creative energy. Visualize carrying it with you as you move forward in your day.  

When you're ready, gently wiggle your fingers, open your eyes, and return with fresh clarity.
