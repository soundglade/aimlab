### Short Meditation Script

Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes gently and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment. And now, exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension.

Take another deep breath in, hold, and exhale. With each breath, feel your body begin to relax. 

Now, bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations—tension, warmth, or tingling. As you exhale, imagine releasing any tightness there. 

Slowly move your awareness up to your legs. With each breath out, let go of any stress in your thighs and calves. Allow them to feel heavy and relaxed.

Continue this process, moving up to your hips, belly, chest, and arms. With each exhale, drop any heaviness and relax deeper.

When you reach your shoulders and neck, visualize the weight of the day melting away. 

Now, take a moment to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply, feeling your body expand. Hold it. Exhale slowly, feeling a sense of calm wash over you.

As you continue to breathe slowly, take a few moments to reflect on something you’re grateful for today. Let that feeling fill your heart and mind.

When you're ready, gently bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes. 

Open your eyes softly, carrying this sense of calm with you as you return to your day.
