persona-id: experienced-meditator
persona: After 15 years of traditional meditation practice, I still find myself curious about new approaches. The tech world has always fascinated me, and I'm genuinely interested in seeing how AI might complement the ancient practices I've come to know so well. I enjoy thoughtfully experimenting with different methods and sharing what I learn with others.
prompt: Could you create a self-inquiry meditation incorporating elements of traditional Advaita Vedanta methods? Preferably with minimal guidance and extended periods of silence for deeper contemplation.

### **Self-Inquiry Meditation**  
*Inspired by Advaita Vedanta, with long silent pauses for direct experience.*

#### **Preparation (1-2 minutes)**
- Find a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed.  
- Sit comfortably with an upright posture.  
- Close your eyes and take a few natural breaths, allowing the mind to settle.

---

#### **Phase 1: Noticing Awareness** *(2-3 minutes)*  
*(gentle guidance, then silence)*  

- Direct your attention to your present experience.  
- Notice thoughts, sensations, and sounds—but don’t follow them.  
- What remains when you do not engage?  

*(Silence follows for direct noticing.)*

#### **Phase 2: The Core Inquiry — “Who Am I?”** *(5-10 minutes)*  
*(Minimal prompts, allowing deep questioning in silence.)*  

- Ask internally: **Who am I?**  
- Do not search for an intellectual answer. Instead, rest in the question itself.  
- If thoughts arise, inquire: **To whom do these thoughts appear?**  
- If an answer comes, ask: **Who is aware of this answer?**  

*(Extended silence follows for direct contemplation.)*

#### **Phase 3: Dissolving Boundaries** *(5-10 minutes)*  
- Is there a boundary where you end and the world begins?  
- Are you the body, the mind, or something prior to both?  
- Look for the "I" that claims to be separate. Can it be found?  

*(Allow ample silent space for insight to arise naturally.)*  

---

#### **Phase 4: Resting in Stillness** *(10+ minutes)*  
- Let go of inquiry. Simply **be**.  
- No effort, no concept, no seeking—just presence.  
- Rest in the awareness that is always here.  

*(Unstructured silence for deep absorption.)*
